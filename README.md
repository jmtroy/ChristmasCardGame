# ChristmasCardTrivia
A game made of Christmas cards with Christmas Trivia

Christmas Card Trivia was created as a game for my family to play before Christmas Eve dinner in 2007.

The game is part treasure hunt, because the cards are spread all around the house, and part trivia because the object is to to find answer cards that matches question cards.
