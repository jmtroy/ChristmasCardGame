*Playing the Christmas Card Trivia Game*

*Objective: To collect as many matching Question and Answer Cards as you possibly can.*

A hint about matching: For a matching pair of cards, not only will the question and answer match, but the border pattern and the picture on the inside will match as well.

Setup: The Christmas Card Trivia Game is meant to be set up and played throughout the entire house. Fold the cards and randomly set them on any suitable surface; tables, kitchen counters, bedroom dressers, the dining room buffet, anywhere.

Teams: The Christmas Card Trivia Game can be played as individuals or in teams. If playing with teams those teams can be chosen in any manner; boys verses girls, children verses adults, couples versus couples, etc.

Play: When the game starts the players start searching for Question and Answer Cards that match. Once a player finds a match that player holds on to the matching cards until the end of the game.

While searching for matching cards each player can hold and carry one unmatched Question Card. A player can set down an unmatched Question Card and pick up a new one at any time.

A player can pick up an Answer Card only long enough to read the answer to see if it matches the Question Card the player is holding. If the cards match the player keeps the cards, if they do not match the player must set the Answer Card down.

The game ends when all the cards have been picked up and matched. Each individual or team counts how many matches they have. The individual or team with the most number of matches is declared the winner.
